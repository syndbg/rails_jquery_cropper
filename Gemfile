gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use a debugger
# gem 'byebug', group: [:development, :test]

group :development, :test do
  # for the dummy app
  gem 'rails'
  gem 'sqlite3'
  gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 3.3.5'
  gem 'sass-rails', '>= 3.2'
